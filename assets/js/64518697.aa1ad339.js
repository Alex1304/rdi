In order to define the dependencies between the services, it is necessary to have a way to refer to them in a unique way. In most cases referring to a service by its class is sufficient. In some other cases however, you may want to have more than one (but a finite number of) instances for the same class in your application, possibly with different dependencies. This can be achieved by giving unique identifiers to these instances, which can be a simple name. RDI allows both ways to refer to services.","sidebar":"docs"},"the-container":{"id":"the-container","title":"The Container","description":"Once you have all your service descriptors set up, it is time to create the most important object in your application: the container.","sidebar":"docs"}}}}')}}]);
